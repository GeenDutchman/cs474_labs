        "For this lab, you will submit an ipython notebook via learningsuite.\n",
        "This lab will be mostly boilerplate code, but you will be required to implement a few extras.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE: you almost certainly will not understand most of what's going on in this lab!\n",
        "That's ok - the point is just to get you going with pytorch.\n",
        "We'll be working on developing a deeper understanding of every part of this code\n",

        "A major goal of this lab is to help you become conversant in working through pytorch\n",

        "So, you should feel free to google whatever you want and need!\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Part 1: Your notebook should contain the boilerplate code. See below.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Part 2: Your notebook should extend the boilerplate code by adding a testing loop.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Part 3: Your notebook should extend the boilerplate code by adding a visualization of test/training performance over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The resulting image could, for example, look like this:\n",

        "Your notebook will be graded on the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* 40% Successfully followed lab video and typed in code\n",

        "* 10% Correct solutions to the microtasks\n",
        "___\n",
        "\n",
        "### Description\n",
        "Throughout this class, we will be using pytorch to implement our deep neural networks. \n",
        "Pytorch is a deep learning framework that handles the low-level details of \n",
        "GPU integration and automatic differentiation.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this lab is to help you become familiar with pytorch. \n",
        "The four parts of the lab are outlined above.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part 1, you should watch the video below, and type in the code as it is explained to you.\n",
        "\n",
        "A more detailed outline of Part 1 is below.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part 2, you must add a validation (or testing) loop using the \n",
        "FashionMNIST dataset with train=False\n",
        "\n",
        "For part 3, you must plot the loss values.\n",
        "\n",
        "For part 4, you must complete the microtasks and pass all asserts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Optional: Demonstrate overfitting on the training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The easiest way to do this is to limit the size of your training dataset \n",
        "so that it only returns a single batch (ie len(dataloader) == batch_size, \n",
        "and train for multiple epochs. For example,\n",
        "I set my batch size to 42, and augmented my dataloader to produce only 42 \n",
        "unique items by overwriting the len function to return 42. \n",
        "In my training loop, I performed a validation every epoch which basically corresponded \n",
        "to a validation every step.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, you will normally compute your validation loss every n steps, \n",
        "rather than at the end of every epoch. This is because some epochs can take hours, \n",
        "or even days and you donâ€™t often want to wait that long to see your results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Testing your algorithm by using a single batch and training until overfitting \n",
        "is a great way of making sure that your model and optimizer are working the way they should!\n",
